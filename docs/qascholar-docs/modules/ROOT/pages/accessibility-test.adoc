== Accessibility Testing

Accessibility features are essential for ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively use software applications. Different disabilities require different assistive technologies and methods of interaction.

Accessibility testing involves evaluating software to ensure it is usable by people with various disabilities. This includes testing for compatibility with assistive technologies, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and adherence to accessibility standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

WCAG provides a comprehensive set of guidelines to make web content more accessible. It covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more usable for people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.

WCAG is organized around four principles, often abbreviated as POUR:

* Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
* Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
* Understandable: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
* Robust: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

Each principle has specific guidelines and success criteria that help developers create accessible content.

*People with disabilities use technology in a variety of ways. Here are some examples*:

* People with hand tremors cannot grip a mouse. They use the keyboard to navigate.
* People with mobility disabilities use their voice to control the computer or mobile device.
* People with mobility disabilities use eye tracking to move the screen cursor.
* People with mobility disabilities use switch devices to operate the computer or mobile device.
* People who are blind use screen readers, braille displays or speech recognition software.
* People with low vision use screen magnification.

Pa11y is a community-driven project that provides resources and tools for accessibility testing. It offers checklists, guidelines, and best practices to help developers ensure their applications are accessible to all users. It has integration with the axe-core accessibility testing engine and HTML CodeSniffer, which can be used to automate accessibility testing in your development workflow.
