== Olama
Ollama is a tool for running and managing large language models (LLMs) locally on your machine. It provides a simple interface to interact with various LLMs without needing an internet connection.

**Installation**

To install Ollama, follow these steps:
1. Visit the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/) and download the installer for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Once installed, you can verify the installation by opening a terminal and typing:    
    ```bash
    ollama --version
    ```
**Using Ollama**
To use Ollama, you need to configure QA Scholar to recognize Ollama as a local LLM provider. Follow these steps:

1. Open the QA Scholar configuration file (usually located at `~/.qascholar/config.yml`).
2. Add the following configuration to specify Ollama as the LLM provider:
   ```yaml
   llm_provider: ollama
   ollama:
     model: <model_name>  # Replace <model_name> with the desired Ollama model
   ```
3. Save the configuration file and restart QA Scholar to apply the changes.

**Running Queries with Ollama**
Once you have configured QA Scholar to use Ollama, you can start running queries. Here’s how to do it:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to your QA Scholar project directory.   
2. Use the following command to run a query using Ollama:
   ```bash
   qascholar query "Your question here"
   ```  
    Replace `"Your question here"` with the actual question you want to ask.
3. QA Scholar will process the query using the specified Ollama model and return the response in the terminal.

**Example Configuration**
Here is an example of a complete QA Scholar configuration file with Ollama set up:
```yaml
llm_provider: ollama
ollama:
  model: llama2-7b  # Example model, replace with your desired model
  temperature: 0.7  # Optional: adjust the creativity of the responses
  max_tokens: 512  # Optional: limit the response length 
```
**Note:** Make sure the model you specify is available in your Ollama installation. You can list available models by running:
```bash 
ollama list
```
**Advanced Configuration**
You can further customize the Ollama configuration in QA Scholar by adding additional parameters such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and others to control the behavior of the LLM. Here’s an example:
```yaml
ollama:
  model: llama2-7b
  temperature: 0.5  # Controls randomness in responses
  max_tokens: 256   # Maximum number of tokens in the response
  top_p: 0.9        # Controls diversity via nucleus sampling   
  frequency_penalty: 0.0  # Penalizes new tokens based on their frequency in the text so far
  presence_penalty: 0.0    # Penalizes new tokens based on whether they
  # appear in the text so far
```
**Common Use Cases**
Ollama can be used in various scenarios within QA Scholar, such as:
- Answering questions based on a specific dataset or knowledge base.
- Generating summaries or explanations of complex topics.
- Assisting in research by providing relevant information from large datasets.
**Example Query**
To demonstrate how to use Ollama with QA Scholar, here’s an example query:
```bash
qascholar query "What are the key features of the Llama 2 model?"
```
QA Scholar will process this query using the configured Ollama model and return a response based on the model's capabilities.
**Best Practices**
- Always ensure that you are using the latest version of Ollama for optimal performance and features.
- Regularly update your models to benefit from improvements and new features.
- Experiment with different models and configurations to find the best fit for your specific use case.
**Security Considerations**
When using Ollama with QA Scholar, consider the following security practices:
- Ensure that your local environment is secure and that only authorized users have access to the QA Scholar configuration files.
- Regularly update Ollama and QA Scholar to the latest versions to mitigate any security vulnerabilities.

**Ollama Commands**
The following are some common Ollama commands that you might find useful when working with QA Scholar:
- `ollama list`: Lists all available models in your Ollama installation.
- `ollama pull <model_name>`: Downloads a specific model from the Ollama repository.
- `ollama run <model_name> --prompt "Your prompt here"`: Runs a specific model with a given prompt.
- `ollama info <model_name>`: Displays information about a specific model, including its capabilities and parameters.

**Ollama API Integration**
Ollama also provides an API that can be used to interact with models programmatically. You
can integrate this API into your applications or scripts to automate tasks or build custom workflows. For more information on using the Ollama API, refer to the [Ollama API documentation](https://ollama.com/docs/api).
**Ollama and QA Scholar Integration**
Ollama can be seamlessly integrated with QA Scholar to enhance your question-answering capabilities. By using Ollama's local LLMs, you can run queries without relying on external services, ensuring faster response times and greater control over your data.


**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues while using Ollama with QA Scholar, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure that Ollama is properly installed and accessible from the terminal.
- Verify that the model specified in the QA Scholar configuration file is available in Ollama.
- Check the QA Scholar logs for any error messages that might indicate what went wrong.
- Consult the [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.com/docs) for additional help and support.

**Additional Resources**
For more information on using Ollama and QA Scholar, refer to the following resources:
- [Ollama Official Documentation](https://ollama.com/docs)
