2. Add the following configuration to specify Ollama as the LLM provider:
   ```yaml
   llm_provider: ollama
   ollama:
     model: <model_name>  # Replace <model_name> with the desired Ollama model
   ```
3. Save the configuration file and restart QA Scholar to apply the changes.
==== Running Queries with Ollama
Once you have configured QA Scholar to use Ollama, you can start running queries. Here’s how to do it:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to your QA Scholar project directory.
