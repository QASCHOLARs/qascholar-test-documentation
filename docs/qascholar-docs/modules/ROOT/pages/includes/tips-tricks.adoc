== Tips & Tricks

The following are some useful tips and tricks that may enhance your experience with the test automation framework and activities

*PlayWright Specific:*

The following are some tips and tricks specific to PlayWright.

1) How to run tests repeatedly to discover flakiness on the tests? *

You can use the `--repeat` option with the Playwright test command to run your tests multiple times. This is useful for identifying flaky tests that may pass or fail intermittently.

Example command:
```bash
npx playwright test --repeat-each= 5 (it can be any number)
```
This command will run your tests 5 times in a row.

for more information, refer to the official Playwright documentation on [Test Runner CLI Options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli#--repeat-each).

It is also recommended to use the `--workers=1` option to ensure that tests are run sequentially, which can help in isolating flaky tests.

```bash
npx playwright test --repeat-each=5 --workers=1
```

*Miscellaneous:*

The following are some miscellaneous tips and tricks.

1) How to find your CPU core count (physical and logical) **


*Option 1*: Using Task Manager (the easiest way)

Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc → opens Task Manager
Go to the Performance tab
Click on CPU on the left
Now look at the bottom right corner — you’ll see:
Cores → physical cores
Logical processors → logical cores

Example:
Cores: 6  
Logical processors: 12  


That means:
You have 6 physical cores
Each core runs 2 threads → 12 logical cores

*Option 2*: Using Command Prompt

Run this in CMD:
wmic cpu get NumberOfCores,NumberOfLogicalProcessors


Example output:
NumberOfCores  NumberOfLogicalProcessors
6              12

*Option 3*: Using PowerShell

Run this:
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Processor | Select-Object NumberOfCores,NumberOfLogicalProcessors

or the newer command:
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor | Select-Object NumberOfCores,NumberOfLogicalProcessors

*Option 4*: Using Node.js (same as Playwright uses)
If you have Node installed, run:

``` javascript
// This script logs the number of CPU cores available on the machine.
// It uses the 'os' module from Node.js to retrieve this information.
// This can be useful for optimizing parallel test execution based on the number of CPU cores.
const os = require('os');
const logical = os.cpus().length;
const physical = logical / 2; // approximate if HT is enabled

console.log(`Logical cores: ${logical}`);
console.log(`Approx physical cores: ${physical}`);
```
