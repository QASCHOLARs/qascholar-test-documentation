== Project Structure
A typical Playwright project has the following structure:

```
📦playwright-orangehrm-autosuite
 ┣ 📂.git
 ┣ 📂.github
 ┃ ┣ 📂chatmodes
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜 🎭 planner.chatmode.md
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📜🎭 generator.chatmode.md

 ┣ 📂tests
 ┣ 📂utils
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Jenkinsfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┣ 📜package.json
 ┣ 📜playwright.config.js

- `tests/`: This directory contains your test files. Each file typically contains one or more test cases.

- `playwright.config.js`: This is the configuration file for Playwright, where you can define settings such as test directory, timeout, retries, and browser options.   

- `package.json`: This file manages your project's dependencies and scripts. It includes Playwright as a dependency and can define scripts to run your tests.

- `node_modules/`: This directory contains all the installed dependencies for your project, including Playwright.

- `utils/`: This directory is used for utility functions that can be shared across multiple test files.

- `pages/`: This directory is typically used for Page Object Model (POM) classes, which help in organizing code related to different pages of the application under test.

- `fixtures/`: This directory can be used to store test fixtures, which are reusable components or setup code for your tests.

- `data/`: This directory can be used to store test data, such as JSON or
    CSV files, that your tests may need to read from.

- `config/`: This directory can be used for configuration files, such as environment settings or test parameters.

- `allure-report/` and `playwright-report/`: These directories are used to store test reports generated by Allure and Playwright, respectively.

- `.github/`: This directory contains GitHub-specific files, such as workflows for CI/CD.

- `.vscode/`: This directory contains Visual Studio Code-specific settings and configurations.

This structure helps in organizing your Playwright tests and related files in a manageable way, making it easier to maintain and scale your test suite as needed.
