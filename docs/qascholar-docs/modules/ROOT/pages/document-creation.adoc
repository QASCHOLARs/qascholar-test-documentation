The purpose of this page is to provide guidelines for creating and organizing project documentation within Confluence. Proper documentation is essential for effective project management, communication, and knowledge sharing among team members and stakeholders.

== Introduction
Project documentation—such as plans, reports, user guides, product manuals, architectural designs, and requirements—supports both the project team and stakeholders. To make these documents easy to find among numerous Confluence pages, it is important to follow a consistent structure and use appropriate labels. This page guides how to structure documentation and which labels to apply for better discoverability.

== Document Structure
To maintain a consistent structure across all project documentation, follow these guidelines:   

* Use clear and descriptive titles for each document.

* Organize documents into relevant categories or sections.

* Include a table of contents for longer documents.

* Use standardized templates for different types of documents (e.g., project plans, status reports, user guides).

* Use headings and subheadings to break down content into manageable sections.

* Utilize bullet points and numbered lists for clarity.

* Include a summary or abstract at the beginning of each document.

* Incorporate visual elements like diagrams, charts, a
nd images to enhance understanding.

* Ensure that all documents are reviewed and updated regularly to maintain accuracy.

== Recommended Labels
Applying appropriate labels to your documents helps in categorizing and retrieving them efficiently. Here are some recommended
labels to use:
* `project-plan` - For documents outlining project plans and timelines.
* `status-report` - For regular updates on project progress.
* `user-guide` - For manuals and guides intended for end-users.
* `technical-documentation` - For documents detailing technical specifications and designs.
* `requirements` - For documents listing project requirements and specifications.
* `meeting-notes` - For records of project meetings and discussions.
* `architecture` - For documents related to system architecture and design.
* `test-plan` - For documents outlining testing strategies and cases.
* `release-notes` - For documents detailing changes and updates in project releases.
* `compliance` - For documents related to regulatory and compliance requirements.
== Best Practices
* Regularly review and update labels to ensure they remain relevant.
* Encourage team members to follow the established structure and labeling conventions.
* Use Confluence's search and filter features to quickly locate documents based on labels.
* Provide training or guidelines for new team members on document creation and labeling standards.

== Conclusion
Effective documentation is crucial for the success of any project. By implementing a consistent structure and using appropriate labels, you can enhance the accessibility and usability of project documents. This not only aids in better project management but also ensures that all stakeholders have the information they need at their fingertips.    

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that project documentation is well-organized, easily accessible, and useful for all stakeholders involved.
